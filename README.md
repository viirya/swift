# Swift for TensorFlow

Welcome to Swift for TensorFlow!

Swift for TensorFlow is a new programming language for TensorFlow. It is a copy of the compiler for the [Swift Programming Language](https://swift.org) that adds first-class compiler and language support for machine learning.

This repository covers the compiler and standard libraries. Please visit the [documentation repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift) for more information about the project, including a project overview, technical details, and guidelines for contributing. To use Swift for TensorFlow out of the box, follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/Installation.md). To build from source, follow the instructions below.

**Note:** Swift for TensorFlow is an early stage research project. It has been released to enable open source development and is not yet ready for general use by machine learning developers.

## Building Swift for TensorFlow

These instructions give the most direct path to a working development environment for Swift for TensorFlow.

**Note:** Building from source is necessary only if you want to modify the source code or build with a custom version of TensorFlow.

To build from source you will need 2 GB of disk space for the source code and over 20 GB of disk space for the build artifacts. A clean build can take multiple hours, but incremental builds will finish much faster.

### System Requirements

macOS, Ubuntu Linux LTS 14.04, and Ubuntu Linux LTS 16.04 are the current
supported host development operating systems.

#### macOS

To build for macOS, you need [Xcode 9.3](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/).
The required version of Xcode changes frequently, and is often a beta release.
Check this document for the current required version.

You will also need [CMake](https://cmake.org), [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org), and [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build), which can be installed via a package manager.

**[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)**

    brew install cmake ninja
    brew cask install caskroom/versions/java8 (required for Bazel)
    brew install bazel (required for TensorFlow support)

Instructions for installing CMake, Ninja, and Bazel directly can be found [below](#build-dependencies).

#### Linux

For Ubuntu, you'll need the following development dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install git cmake ninja-build clang python uuid-dev libicu-dev icu-devtools libbsd-dev libedit-dev libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev swig libpython-dev libncurses5-dev pkg-config libblocksruntime-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev autoconf libtool systemtap-sdt-dev tzdata rsync

Additionally, [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build) is required to build with TensorFlow support. Ubuntu installation instructions are [here](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html).

**Note:** LLDB currently requires at least `swig-1.3.40` but will successfully build
with version 2 shipped with Ubuntu.

Additional build instructions for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS can be found [here](docs/Ubuntu14.md). These are necessary for building Swift for TensorFlow correctly.

### Getting Sources for Swift and Related Projects

First, create a directory for all of the Swift sources:

    mkdir swift-source
    cd swift-source

**Note:** This is important since update-checkout (see below) checks out
repositories next to the Swift source directory. This means that if one clones
Swift and has other unrelated repositories, update-checkout may not clone those
repositories and will update them instead.

**TensorFlow Support:** To build with TensorFlow support, the `update-checkout-config-tensorflow.json` configuration file must be specified when cloning sources. The configuration file pins specific versions of every Swift companion directory and is updated with every upstream merge from the Apple Swift repositories. 

**Via HTTPS**  For those checking out sources as read-only, HTTPS works best:

    git clone https://github.com/google/swift.git -b tensorflow
    ./swift/utils/update-checkout --clone --config swift/utils/update-checkout-config-tensorflow.json

**Via SSH**  For those who plan on regularly making direct commits,
cloning over SSH may provide a better experience (which requires
[uploading SSH keys to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)):

    git clone git@github.com:google/swift.git -b tensorflow
    ./swift/utils/update-checkout --clone-with-ssh --config swift/utils/update-checkout-config-tensorflow.json

### Building Swift

The `build-script` is a high-level build automation script that supports basic
options such as building a Swift-compatible LLDB, building the Swift Package
Manager, building for various platforms, running tests after builds, and more.

There are two primary build systems to use: Xcode and Ninja. The Xcode build
system allows you to work in Xcode, but Ninja is a bit faster and supports
more environments.

To build using Ninja, run:

    ./swift/utils/build-script --enable-tensorflow --release-debuginfo

When developing Swift, it helps to build what you're working on in a debug
configuration while building the rest of the project with optimizations. Below
are some examples of using debug variants:

    ./swift/utils/build-script --enable-tensorflow --release-debuginfo --debug-swift # Swift frontend built in debug
    ./swift/utils/build-script --enable-tensorflow --release-debuginfo --debug-swift-stdlib # Standard library built in debug
    ./swift/utils/build-script --enable-tensorflow --release-debuginfo --debug-swift --force-optimized-typechecker # Swift frontend sans type checker built in debug

Limiting the amount of debug code in the compiler has a very large impact on
Swift compile times, and in turn the test execution time. If you want to build
the entire project in debug, you can run:

    ./swift/utils/build-script  --enable-tensorflow --debug

For documentation of all available arguments, as well as additional usage
information, see the inline help:

    ./swift/utils/build-script -h

### TensorFlow Support

To enable TensorFlow support, specify the `--enable-tensorflow` flag:

    ./swift/utils/build-script --enable-tensorflow

By default, TensorFlow will be automatically cloned from GitHub and built from source using Bazel. If you want to build with custom TensorFlow headers and shared libraries, please specify the `tensorflow-host-include-dir` and `tensorflow-host-lib-dir` arguments:

    ./swift/utils/build-script --enable-tensorflow --tensorflow-host-include-dir=<path_to_tensorflow_headers> --tensorflow-host-lib-dir=<path_to_tensorflow_libraries>

Below is more information about the arguments:

* `enable-tensorflow`: If true, enables TensorFlow support for Swift.
    * Default value: `False`.
* `build-tensorflow`: If true, automatically clone and build TensorFlow from source.
    * Default value: If `enable-tensorflow` is `True` and `tensorflow-host-lib-dir` and `tensorflow-host-include-dir` are not specified, then `True`. Otherwise, `False`.
* `host-bazel`: The absolute path to Bazel, used to build TensorFlow.
    * By default, the path is auto detected.
* `tensorflow-bazel-options`: Comma separated options passed to Bazel when building TensorFlow, e.g. `--copt=-mavx,--copt=-msse4.2`.
    * Default: None.
* `tensorflow-host-include-dir`: A directory containing custom TensorFlow headers.
    * Default value: None.
* `tensorflow-host-lib-dir`: A directory containing custom TensorFlow shared libraries (`libtensorflow.so` and `libtensorflow_framework.so`).
    * Default value: None.

#### Xcode

To build using Xcode, specify the `--xcode` argument on any of the above commands.
Xcode can be used to edit the Swift source code, but it is not currently
fully supported as a build environment for SDKs other than macOS. The generated
Xcode project does not integrate with the test runner, but the tests can be run
with the 'check-swift' target.

#### Build Products

All of the build products are placed in `swift-source/build/${TOOL}-${MODE}/${PRODUCT}-${PLATFORM}/`.
If macOS Swift with Ninja in DebugAssert mode was built, all of the products
would be in `swift-source/build/Ninja-DebugAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64/`. It
helps to save this directory as an environment variable for future use.

    export SWIFT_BUILD_DIR="~/swift-source/build/Ninja-DebugAssert/swift-macosx-x86_64"

#### Ninja

Once the first build has completed, Ninja can perform fast incremental builds of
various products. These incremental builds are a big timesaver when developing
and debugging.

    cd ${SWIFT_BUILD_DIR}
    ninja swift

This will build the Swift compiler, but will not rebuild the standard library or
any other target. Building the `swift-stdlib` target as an additional layer of
testing from time to time is also a good idea. To build just the standard
library, run:

    ninja swift-stdlib

It is always a good idea to do a full build after using `update-checkout`.

#### Using Xcode

To open the Swift project in Xcode, open `${SWIFT_BUILD_DIR}/Swift.xcodeproj`.
It will auto-create a *lot* of schemes for all of the available targets. A
common debug flow would involve:

 - Select the 'swift' scheme.
 - Pull up the scheme editor (⌘⇧<).
 - Select the 'Arguments' tab and click the '+'.
 - Add the command line options.
 - Close the scheme editor.
 - Build and run.

Another option is to change the scheme to "Wait for executable to be launched",
then run the build product in Terminal.

### Build Failures

Make sure you are using the [correct release](#macos) of Xcode.

If you have changed Xcode versions but still encounter errors that appear to
be related to the Xcode version, try passing `--rebuild` to `build-script`.

When a new version of Xcode is released, you can update your build without
recompiling the entire project by passing the `--reconfigure` option.

Make sure all repositories are up to date with the `update-checkout` command
described above.

## Testing Swift

The simplest way to run the Swift test suite is by passing the `--test` and
`--validation-test` flags to `build-script`:

    ./swift/utils/build-script --enable-tensorflow --test --validation-test

Swift for TensorFlow adds the following new test suites:

- [test/AutoDiff](test/AutoDiff): tests for [automatic differentiation](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift/blob/master/docs/AutomaticDifferentiation.md).
- [test/TensorFlow](test/TensorFlow): TensorFlow infrastructure tests that don't
  depend on the TensorFlow runtime.
- [test/TensorFlowRuntime](test/TensorFlowRuntime): TensorFlow runtime tests.

Before submitting pull requests involving large code changes, please run the
command above locally to ensure all tests pass.

For more details on testing, see [docs/Testing.md](docs/Testing.md), in
particular the section on [lit.py](docs/Testing.md#using-litpy).

## Build Dependencies

### CMake
[CMake](https://cmake.org) is the core infrastructure used to configure builds of
Swift and its companion projects; at least version 3.4.3 is required.

On macOS, you can download the [CMake Binary Distribution](https://cmake.org/download),
bundled as an application, copy it to `/Applications`, and add the embedded
command line tools to your `PATH`:

    export PATH=/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin:$PATH

On Linux, if you have not already installed Swift's [development
dependencies](#linux), you can download and install the CMake
package separately using the following command:

    sudo apt-get install cmake


### Ninja
[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) is the current recommended build system
for building Swift and is the default configuration generated by CMake. [Pre-built
packages](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/wiki/Pre-built-Ninja-packages)
are available for macOS and Linux distributions. You can also clone Ninja
next to the other projects and it will be bootstrapped automatically:

**Via HTTPS**

    git clone https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja.git && cd ninja
    git checkout release
    cat README

**Via SSH**

    git clone git@github.com:ninja-build/ninja.git && cd ninja
    git checkout release
    cat README

### Bazel
[Bazel](https://bazel.build) is the build tool used to build TensorFlow. Installing Bazel is necessary for building Swift with TensorFlow support.

The Bazel website has detailed installation instructions for [macOS](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-os-x.html) and [Ubuntu](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install-ubuntu.html).
